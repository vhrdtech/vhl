How fast is it?
---
Although speed is not a primary goal, vhL is quite fast (TODO: put some numbers here).
Speed optimisation is not a primary goal right now, because it does not impact generated code in any way.

Why there is no? references / pointers?

The goal of the language is to express how to communicate. References is a target language
specific optimisation primitive. You can configure how target code is generated in (TODO: provide a link).
